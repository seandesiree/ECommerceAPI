E-Commerce API

In this project I developed that uses the functions of  CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It consists of the endpoints for managing differnet tables in the database. Through the use of POSTMAN the user can manipulate the tables and add new customers, new customer accounts, place new orders, and give the customer tracking information.
